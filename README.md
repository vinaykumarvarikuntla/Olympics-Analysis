### Project Overview

 **Problem Statement**

The Olympic Games, considered to be the world's foremost sports competition has more than 200 nations participating across the Summer and Winter Games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart.

Throughout this project, we explored the Olympics dataset (scraped from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-time_Olympic_Games_medal_table), looked at some interesting statistics and then tried to find out which country is the King of Olympic Games.

The dataset has details of 146 countries with following 16 features


- Country_Name	  -- Name of the country
- # Summer	          -- No. of games played in Summer Olympics
- Gold_Summer	  -- No. of gold medals won in Summer Olympics
- Silver_Summer	  -- No. of silver medals won in Summer Olympics
- Bronze_Summer  -- No. of bronze medals won in Summer Olympics
- Total_Summer	  -- Total no. of all the medals won in Summer Olympics
- # Winter	          -- No. of games played in Winter Olympics
- Gold_Winter	  -- No. of gold medals won in Winter Olympics
- Silver_Winter	  -- No. of silver medals won in Winter Olympics
- Bronze_Winter	  -- No. of bronze medals won in Winter Olympics
- Total_Winter	  -- Total no. of all the medals won in Winter Olympics
- # Games	          -- Total no. of games played in both Summer and Winter Olympics
- Gold_Total	          -- Total no. of gold medals won in both Summer and Winter Olympics
- Silver_Total	          -- Total no. of silver medals won in both Summer and Winter Olympics
- Bronze_Total	  -- Total no. of bronze medals won in both Summer and Winter Olympics
- Total                       -- Total no. of all the medals won in both Summer and Winter Olympics

- Dataframe operations
- Conditional statement and loops
- List operations
- Bar Plotting
- Mathematical operations
